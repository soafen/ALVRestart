## Functionality
this is a tiny program i mainly made for my own use but it has:
- a dark/light mode toggle
- a customizable choice of browser process so you can make sure ALVRestart kills the one ALVR is using
- 'Kill' button that doesn't restart ALVR. useful for quickly killing SteamVR and ALVR.

i am not a software developer. i'm aspiring, but this is just a small visual basic program made for my needs.
i am always open to contributions ! ðŸ’–
